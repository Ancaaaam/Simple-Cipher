# Simple-Cipher

This encryption algorithm involves right-shifting each character within the alphabet a certain number of times. For example, the text ANABANANA becomes BOBCBOBOB when the step is 1. Thus, an encryption with step 26 does not change the letter, since the English alphabet has 26 characters.

For this task you will need to implement in the simple.asm file the simple() function, which encrypts a string using the method described above.
